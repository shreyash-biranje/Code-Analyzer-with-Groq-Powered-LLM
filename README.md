Here's a sample README file tailored to your Streamlit app:

Code Analyzer with Groq-Powered LLM

Overview

This Streamlit application leverages the Groq API and Llama 3.3 (70B) model to analyze Python code, identifying potential bottlenecks, explaining issues, and suggesting improvements.

Features

- Analyzes Python code for performance bottlenecks
- Provides clear explanations of identified issues
- Offers suggestions for code optimization and improvement
- Utilizes the Groq API and Llama 3.3 (70B) model for accurate analysis

Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Groq API key

Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone (link unavailable)
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set your Groq API key as an environment variable: export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
4. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run (link unavailable)

Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Paste your Python code into the input area
3. Click the "Analyze Code" button to initiate the analysis
4. Review the results, including identified bottlenecks, explanations, and suggested improvements

Limitations

- This application is designed to analyze Python code only
- The accuracy of the analysis results depends on the quality of the input code and the capabilities of the Groq API and Llama 3.3 (70B) model

Future Development

- Expand the application to support analysis of other programming languages
- Implement additional features, such as code refactoring or optimization suggestions
- Explore integrating other AI models or tools to enhance the application'sÂ capabilities
